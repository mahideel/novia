The purpose of this chapter is to build a sub-model using selected metabolites and use this sub-model to build a bigger model that will incorporate metabolic pathway. 

Therefore this chapter has been organised into two parts:

1. Building a sub-model using selected metabolites

   This is basically applying the variable selection method I identified in my literature review. 

2. Using the sub-model to build a bigger model by applying the hierarchical model I created in Chapter 1 and 2 and extend it to accomodate pathway construction.
