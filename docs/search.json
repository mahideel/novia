      "contents": "\nBayesian statistics began when Bayes theorem was first postulated by The Rev Thomas Bayes in 1763 (Bayes 1763) (1). Bayes theorem has been described as a way of combining a prior distribution for a parameter with the likelihood to provide a posterior distribution for the parameter (Cox and Hinkley 1979).\n\\[p\\left(\\theta\\mid x\\right)\\propto p\\left(x\\mid\\theta\\right) \n  \\tag{1} \n\\]\nIn other words, the computation of the posterior requires three terms: a prior [\\(p\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)], a likelihood [\\(p\\left(x\\mid\\theta\\right)\\)] and an observation [\\(p\\left(x\\mid\\theta\\right)\\)]. The prior and likelihood can easily be computed as they are part of the assumed knowledge or model. The observation, which is a normalisation factor, requires complex integration that becomes intractable in high dimensions (2).\n\\[p(x)=\\int_{\\theta}p\\left(x\\mid\\theta\\right)p\\left(\\theta\\right)d\\theta\n  \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe emergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) coupled with the advancement of computational power/method in 1990s changed the game altogether (Ashby 2006). It makes the calculation of those complex integration possible. 1990s is a time of rapid expansion for Bayesian statistics.\nThe power of MCMC were widely applied in various aspects of medicine, for example, disease screening, immunology, genetic and epidemiology.\nThe application of Bayesian statistics was gradually focusing on not just building a model using conditional independence modeling but more so on the application of hierarchical models and longitudinal models to tackle various medical challenges (Ashby 2006), such as prevalence estimates for depression in adolescents from two-stage sampling (Erkanli, Soyer, and Stangl 1997) and hierarchical model for multi-level repeated ordinal data in anesthesiology (Tan et al. 1999).\nIn more recent time (2000 - today), faster computational methods and the advancement in the omics field have enabled Bayesian statistics to be used to address even more complex medical applications, such as Markov modelling of changes in HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in untreated patients (Kousignian et al. 2003), hierarchical modelling for spatio-temporal modelling of influenza (Mugglin, Cressie, and Gemmell 2002), and DNA sequence segmentation (Boys and Henderson 2004).\n\n\n\nAshby, Deborah. 2006. “Bayesian Statistics in Medicine: A 25 Year Review.” Statistics in Medicine 25 (21): 3589–3631.\n\n\nBayes, Thomas. 1763. “LII.

      "contents": "\nAs of 7th April 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has spread to 223 countries, infected > 133.5 million people and killed > 2.8 million people (WHO 2021).\nSimilar to other viral infections, every individual responses differently to the virus. Most individuals experience mild sore throat, fever and fatigue. Some are even asymptomatic. However, a subset of individuals experience severe respiratory distress, organ failure and cytokine storm that results in death (Ayres 2020; Kimhofer et al. 2020).\nMultiple metabolomics studies have been conducted in an attempt to unravel COVID-19. They found that several amino acids were found to be positively correlated with COVID-19 (Pang et al. 2021; Delafiori et al. 2021; Cai et al. 2020; Blasco et al. 2020; Thomas et al. 2020; Kimhofer et al. 2020).\nSeveral common metabolic pathways, such as porphyrin, cellular amino acidarachidonic acid metabolism were found to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 patients (Pang et al. 2021). Propanoate metabolism, was identified by Pang et al (2021) as a novel pathway in the progression of COVID-19. Other metabolic pathways such as TCA, selenocompound, mannose and glutathione metabolism were found to be associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19 (Pang et al. 2021; Polonikov 2020; Li et al. 2020)\nSimply put, each individual’s immune system is unique, it relies on multiple metabolic pathways, such as amino acid, energy and lipid metabolism, to initiate and regulate response to COVID-19. Thus it is extremely important to take these individual level’s information and pathways information or knowledge into account when conducting a statistical analysis.\n\n\n\nAyres, Janelle S. 2020. “A Metabolic Handbook for the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Nature Metabolism 2 (7): 572–85.\n\n\nBlasco, H, C Bessy, L Plantier, A Lefevre, E Piver, L Bernard, J Marlet, et al. 2020. “The Specific Metabolome Profiling of Patients Infected by SARS-COV-2 Supports the Key Role of Tryptophan-Nicotinamide Pathway and Cytosine Metabolism.” Scientific Reports 10 (1): 1–12.\n\n\nCai, Yuping, Daniel J Kim, Takehiro Takahashi, David I Broadhurst, Shuangge Ma, Nicholas JW Rattray, Arnau Casanovas-Massana, et al. 2020. “Kynurenic Acid Underlies Sex-Specific Immune Responses to COVID-19.” MedRxiv.\n\n\nDelafiori, Jeany, Luiz Claudio Navarro, Rinaldo Focaccia Siciliano, Gisely Cardoso De Melo, Estela Natacha Brandt Busanello, José Carlos Nicolau, Geovana Manzan Sales, et al. 2021. “Covid-19 Automated Diagnosis and Risk Assessment Through Metabolomics and Machine Learning.” Analytical Chemistry 93 (4): 2471–79.\n\n\nKimhofer, Torben, Samantha Lodge, Luke Whiley, Nicola Gray, Ruey Leng Loo, Nathan G Lawler, Philipp Nitschke, et al. 2020. “Integrative Modeling of Quantitative Plasma Lipoprotein, Metabolic, and Amino Acid Data Reveals a Multiorgan Pathological Signature of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.” Journal of Proteome Research 19 (11): 4442–54.\n\n\nLi, Zhi, Guoliang Liu, Ling Wang, Yong Liang, Qunfang Zhou, Fei Wu, Jing Yao, and Bolei Chen. 2020. “From the Insight of Glucose Metabolism Disorder: Oxygen Therapy and Blood Glucose Monitoring Are Crucial for Quarantined COVID-19 Patients.” Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety 197: 110614.\n\n\nPang, Zhiqiang, Guangyan Zhou, Jasmine Chong, and Jianguo Xia. 2021. “Comprehensive Meta-Analysis of COVID-19 Global Metabolomics Datasets.” Metabolites 11 (1): 44.\n\n\nPolonikov, Alexey. 2020. “Endogenous Deficiency of Glutathione as the Most Likely Cause of Serious Manifestations and Death in COVID-19 Patients.” ACS Infectious Diseases 6 (7): 1558–62.\n\n\nThomas, Tiffany, Davide Stefanoni, Julie A Reisz, Travis Nemkov, Lorenzo Bertolone, Richard O Francis, Krystalyn E Hudson, et al. 2020. “COVID-19 Infection Alters Kynurenine and Fatty Acid Metabolism, Correlating with IL-6 Levels and Renal Status.” JCI Insight 5 (14).\n\n\nWHO, World Health Organization. 2021. “Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic.” https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe most common statistical methods used to analyse metabolomics data are Principal component analysis (PCA) for unsupervised learning and Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) or Orthogonal projections to laten structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) for supervised one (Gromski et al. 2015; Ren et al. 2015; Lee, Liong, and Jemain 2018).\nput graph similar to Gromski et al (2015) Fig1 page 13.\nIn 2020 alone, there are 137 metabolomics studies that includes PLS-DA as a tool for the analysis of metabolomics data (from PubMed using keywords [metabolomic; PLS and PLS-DA]).\nIn metabolomic studies, we tend to get a high-dimensional dataset, e.g. hundreds of metabolites, peak locations. What we want is to find a few combinations of those variables that would be best explain the total variation in the original dataset (Ren et al. 2015). In other words, we need to significantly reduce the dimensionality of our dataset. This is where PCA comes in.\nPCA is widely used as a dimension-reduction method. Its main aim is to replace all correlated variables by a much smaller number of uncorrelated variables (Principal Components or PCs) while still retaining most of the original information (Ren et al. 2015) by producing the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables.\nPCA is often used as a precursor or preliminary step prior to conducting PLS-DA.\nPLS-DA can be regarded as a linear two-class classifier which aims to find a straight line that divides the space into two regions (Brereton and Lloyd 2014). It is similar to PCA in a sense that it also produces the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables, and also classes. After rotation by weight matrix, the new variables would contain relationship with classes.\nThe fundamental of PLS-DA equations are (Wold, Sjöström, and Eriksson 2001; Ren et al. 2015):\n\\[\nY=UQ'+F\n\\] \\[\nX=TP'+E\n\\]\nT and U are called X and Y scores matrices formed by latent variables. P and Q are called X and Y loadings that serves as weight matrices. E and F are residuals, which are the remaining variations that can not be explained by latent variables.\nOPLS-DA is an extension of PLS-DA. It is designed to remove systematic variation in X that is orthogonal to Y in an attempt to enhance the interpretation of PLS (Wold, Sjöström, and Eriksson 2001; Ren et al. 2015).\nThe combination of PCA and PLS-DA has been found to be powerful. However, there are some limitations that are associated with these methods.\nLimitations associated with PCA (Ren et al. 2015; Blasco et al. 2015):\nProne to outliers\nThe groups that are shown in the PCA scores plot are not necessarily the biologically meaningful groups.\nPCA only works if the first few PCs can explain a large proportion of the variability. Otherwise, the visualisation results may be misleading.\nLimitations associated with PLS-DA (Gromski et al. 2015; Ren et al. 2015; Lee, Liong, and Jemain 2018; Brereton and Lloyd 2014):\nDoes not handle missing values well.\nTend to overfit when the number of variables is significantly greater than the number of samples (p>>n issue).\nThe internal validation may be too optimistic.\nCan be misleading when the number of variables is significantly greater than the number of samples (p>>n issue).\nThe problem is that because there are so many variables, there are some correlations that occurred just by chance.\nBrereton and Lloyd (2015) .\n\n\nDoes not incorporate pathway information.\nBlasco et al (2015) did a comparative analysis of targeted metabolomics. They conducted H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and non-ALS patients. The aim of their study was to discriinate ALS patients and non-ALS subjects and to identify the variables relevant for this discrimination (Blasco et al. 2015).\nIt was found that the most relevant metabolites to explain ALS are low concentration of acetate and high concentration of pyruvate. Alamine was not identified as relevant, however, it appears to be important when associated with high levels of pyruvate. Another metabolite, creatinine-creatinine were also not found to be relevant. However, this metabolite pair increases in importance when associated with low level of pyruvate. The above finding implicates pyruvate in the pathogenesis of ALS. This illustrates how important it is to take the interpretation of biochemical pathway into consideration as they provide the big picture of the dynamic of the overall metabolism.\n\n\nCan not incorporate individual level of information - every individual responses differently to COVID-19. Every individual has their own timeline associated with fighting this virus. This has significant bearings on the dynamic of metabolic perturbation that occurs in each individual. Echoing what has been said in numerous COVID-19 studies, each individual’s immune system is unique, it relies on multiple metabolic pathways to initiate and regulate response to COVID-19 It is therefore vital to choose a statistical method that can incorporate these individual level’s information including pathways information into account in model building.\n\n\n\nBlasco, Hélène, J Błaszczyński, Jean-Charles Billaut, Lydie Nadal-Desbarats, Pierre-François Pradat, DAVID Devos, Caroline Moreau, et al. 2015. “Comparative Analysis of Targeted Metabolomics: Dominance-Based Rough Set Approach Versus Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis.” Journal of Biomedical Informatics 53: 291–99.\n\n\nBrereton, Richard G, and Gavin R Lloyd. 2014. “Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis: Taking the Magic Away.” Journal of Chemometrics 28 (4): 213–25.\n\n\nGromski, Piotr S, Howbeer Muhamadali, David I Ellis, Yun Xu, Elon Correa, Michael L Turner, and Royston Goodacre. 2015. “A Tutorial Review: Metabolomics and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis–a Marriage of Convenience or a Shotgun Wedding.” Analytica Chimica Acta 879: 10–23.\n\n\nLee, Loong Chuen, Choong-Yeun Liong, and Abdul Aziz Jemain. 2018. “Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) for Classification of High-Dimensional (HD) Data: A Review of Contemporary Practice Strategies and Knowledge Gaps.” Analyst 143 (15): 3526–39.\n\n\nRen, Sheng, Anna A Hinzman, Emily L Kang, Rhonda D Szczesniak, and Long Jason Lu. 2015. “Computational and Statistical Analysis of Metabolomics Data.” Metabolomics 11 (6): 1492–1513.\n\n\nWold, Svante, Michael Sjöström, and Lennart Eriksson. 2001. “PLS-Regression: A Basic Tool of Chemometrics.” Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 58 (2): 109–30.\n\n\n\n\n",

A typical Bayesian workflow have three main aspects:\ncapturing pre-existing knowledge about a given parameter in a statistical model via the formulation of prior distribution.\ndetermining the likelihood function of the parameters using the observed data.\ncombining both the prior distribution and the likelihood function using Bayes’ theorem in the form of the posterior distribution.\nBayesian workflow (Schoot et al. 2021)\n\n\n\nHierarchical Bayesian Model\nIt is a multi-level Bayesian modeling which enables us to make scientific inferences about a population based on many individuals (or observations).\nIt allows the incorporation of the pathway information as a ‘grouping’ mechanism in the model hierarchy.\nIt allows the incorporation of each unique individual as a ‘grouping’ mechanism in the model hierarchy.\nIn other words, we would be able to include clinical/metabolomics information down to an individual level such as different immune responses to COVID-19, which translates to different starting point, disease trajectory, recovery time etc, in the model.\n\nHierarchical Bayesian - parameter flow (Taboga 2017)\n\n\n\nThe original Bayes theorem:\n\\[p\\left(\\theta\\mid x\\right)\\propto p\\left(x\\mid\\theta\\right) \n  \\tag{1} \n\\]\nThe hierarchical Bayes theorem:\n\\[\np\\left(\\alpha,\\theta\\mid x\\right)\\propto p\\left(x\\mid\\theta,\\alpha\\right)p\\left(\\alpha\\right)\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n(\\(\\propto\\) = proportional to)\nGiven the observed data x, in a hierarchical Bayesian model, the likelihood depends on two parameter vectors \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) \\[p\\left(x\\mid\\theta,\\alpha\\right)\\]\nand the prior\n\\[\np\\left(\\alpha,\\theta\\right)=p\\left(\\theta\\mid\\alpha\\right)p\\left(\\alpha\\right)\n\\]\nis specified by separately specifying the conditional distribution \\(p\\left(\\theta\\mid\\alpha\\right)\\) and the distribution \\(p\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\)\nIn this special case, the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is called hyper-parameter and the prior \\(p\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\) is called hyper-prior.\nA Schematic Illustration of Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (Ahn, Haines, and Zhang 2016)\n\n\n\nIllustration with dummy data\nDummy scenario:\nA metabolite concentration level was obtained from 260 individuals from various ethnic backgrounds. The sample collection was done in 10 different hospitals. These hospitals are scattered over different locations. Each hospital is considered as a representative of the surrounding suburbs where it is located. It is hypothesized that the metabolites concentration level is influenced by ethnicity and the environment factor (socio-economy status, diet, lifestyle etc).
