Variable selection method commonly used in metabolomics

- What are the available methods out there? 
- Bayesian vs. Frequentist selection method

  - pros and cons of each
  - any gap to fill?
  - what is the most approproate one for metabolites selection? 
    
    - NOTE: our metabolites are highly correlated with one another, so whichever method I end up selecting must be able to handle multi-collinearity well and able to impose sparsity to reduce the high-dimensionality.
